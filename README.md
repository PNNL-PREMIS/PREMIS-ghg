### Soil GHG experiment

#### Motivation
Disturbances such as sea level rise, increased extreme weather events, and climate change can have lasting impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. Monitoring greenhouse gas fluxes at the terrestrial-aquatic interface offers a way to quantify the stability and resilience of terrestrial soils in a stressed environment. 

#### Design
We are testing soil response to salt water intrusion by monitoring soil respiration rates along a creek transect at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center [(SERC)](https://serc.si.edu/). We have transplanted soil cores (40 cm diameter, 20 cm depth) along a salinity and elevation gradient at three locations (~1 km between salinity plots, ~50 m between elevation plots). This design will also be replicated on the west coast at Beaver Creek. We hypothesize that an increase in salinity will *suppress* soil respiration.
