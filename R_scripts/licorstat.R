# We are interested in understanding the drivers of soil respiration
# (`Flux`, Âµmol/m2/s). Variables that we have a priori reason to 
# think might be influential include soil temperature (measured at two depths,
# 5 and 20 cm), soil moisture (measured at 0-10 cm), and salinity (measured
# by the continuous dataloggers). Here we examine all except the last.

# We suspect (and preliminary data exploration showed) that Flux will
# be nonlinear with soil temperature, and its variability will
# increase with temperature. So we transform  the dependent variable
# via log(). In addition, soil moisture may limit soil respiration
# both when it's very low (when the microbes don't have enough water to
# function) and very high (when they don't have enough oxygen). To
# handle this, we fit a quadratic moisture function.

# Finally, the salinity level (GCREW versus Canoe Shed versus North Branch)
# might exert an effect (due to differing soil types, for example).
# But this isn't a treatment, so we'll model is as a *random* effect.
# To do so we use a linear mixed-effects model.
