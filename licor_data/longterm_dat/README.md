# longterm_dat

This folder holds data downloaded from the continuous LI-8100 ("Stuart").

The data files can get quite large (for example, `SALT_20181207_LT.81x` downloaded 24 January 2019 was 230 MB!). Because GitHub limits file sizes, we first split such files into smaller subsets, e.g. `SALT_20181207_LT_a.81x`, `SALT_20181207_LT_b.81x`, etc.
